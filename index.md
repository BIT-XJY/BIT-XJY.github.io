## About Me

I received the B.E degree in vehicle engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2020. Iâ€™m currently a Master student in Intelligent Vehicle Research Center at Beijing Institute of Technology. I am trying to apply learning methods to intelligent vehicles and robots.

## Research Interests

- Semantic segmentation
- Energy management stategies, deep reinforcement learning, transfer learning

## News
